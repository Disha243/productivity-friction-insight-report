2,"Easy to understand, easy to keep lists. Way too many bugs. When creating custom rules, these only seem to be applied 50% of the time. Calendar shows tickets on the wrong days, with no way of correcting it. And much more. Very limited in functionality. Would not be surprised if this app can be oneshotted with ChatGPT or similar, except for the cloud functionality and sync.",2025-11-25 23:34:35
1,"Quick-add keeps appearing, setting is not kept. Could you please keep my setting, not to see the quick-add !? Very annoying to hide again after every update. Reduced to one star as my settings keep being reset with each update. Very annoying.",2025-11-25 17:09:19
2,"Biggy UI and doesn't have auto save. Imagine typing a paragraph in the description and then switching apps to another one for reference or closing it and switching notes thinking it's saved and then realizing it's not because you forgot to press the green checkmark. So stupid. Luckily, I spent most of my time in a web browser. But if I had to rely on the mobile app, I would pull my hair out.",2025-11-21 20:48:35

5,AMAZING,2025-11-17 00:43:39
2,Each update makes the UI a little harder to use. Move is never what I want when I'm dragging a task. So don't make it get in the way of archiving,2025-11-13 16:46:48
5,"Very functional, even on the free version.",2025-11-11 20:15:33
3,"The web app is amazing, the mobile app is lacking and missing critical functions. How come on the mobile app I can't seem to copy a checklist easily from another card, for example? Am I the potato or are you guys just trash at UX? These little things are making me want to try a new service and I've used Trello for years now",2025-11-10 21:29:25
2,UX on widget is not very good,2025-11-09 01:30:16
