f9d2c427-bb68-4e53-b7db-29d8cb2727cd,CHIHAB LARAICHI,3,"in fact, there ate many things to be improved and added. for example, Notion doesn't show covers of pages even I add covers. when I add a cover to a page, I see the cover when I click on the page but in the preview of the page in gallery view it shows either another cover or it doesn't show it at all. you should fix this in the mobile and the desktop app. further more, there are more and more features you should add. the ability to draw in the page without external whiteboards, adding shapes...",0,2025-11-29T23:17:39,,
147ab6ec-1096-4c71-97c9-2aa2dd8096b0,Anurag Subedi,1,I love notion all in one productivity . I switched from Google workspace to notion hoping to get all in one productivity tool . I loved it the web version is super . But The android App of Notion is trash and horrible . It's too heavy and resource usage . Takes 4-5 to open app or switch pages . Lags a lot . And notion calendar app is trash . It doesn't even open,0,2025-11-29T16:54:11,,
