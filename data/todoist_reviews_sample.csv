The layout and features in the free version are really helpful in organising my tasks, I would get the paid version when I can afford it. I wish it has a one time life fee though.",0,2025-12-01T15:04:20,"Hi Ibukunoluwa 👋 Thanks so much for your feedback. We’re really glad to hear that the free version is already helping you stay organized, and understand your wish for a one time lifetime payment instead of a subscription. We’ve shared this with our team so they can keep it in mind as we continue to review our pricing options 🤗",2025-12-01T15:15:06

cf92d45b-5e30-4a8e-8b2a-c7e519b7e67c,Aditya Bathri,5,"this app is very useful in tasks This To-Do List app is really helpful and easy to use. The interface is clean and simple, which makes adding and completing tasks very smooth. The reminder feature works perfectly and helps me stay organized every day. The app is lightweight and does not slow down my phone at all. I use it daily and it has become a part of my routine. Great job to the developer – keep it up! 👍 Suggestion: If dark mode, widget, and custom notification tones are added in the futu",0,2025-11-29T12:49:01,"We appreciate you taking the time to share such positive feedback!

a0df7e8b-f973-4a98-9dda-ecefce28759c,Tom Hayden,5,"It would be great if the home screen widget could show connected calendar events along with tasks for the day / upcoming days. Also, unless I'm being dense, there doesn't seem to be a way to make an already created task a sub-task of another without dragging which is not always easy if the tasks aren't near each other in the list or if both have been found by searching it can't be done at all. This feels like an important change. 🙏🏼🙏🏼",2,2025-11-29T12:13:37,Hey Tom. Thank you for your kind review and thoughtful suggestion 🤗 We completely understand how helpful it would be to see your connected calendar events right alongside your Todoist tasks in your widget.

However, I wished it had a feature that allows you to pick certain apps and it will just make task suggestions based on an AI overview. It would make it easy for me to also manage the amount of time I spend doing certain work and hobbies.",0,2025-11-29T11:15:37,That's a fantastic idea for an AI-powered feature to generate task suggestions based on activity in other apps!

It helps to ensure my jobs as a Specialist Kitchen Hand (SKH) at Hungry Jack's are always completed on time, and it helps me to stay on top of chores at home. On the topic of mental health, I have an idea to help expand your app further and transform it from just a To Do List app, to a mentally equipped chore app. If you can add a feature where we can assign ""breaks,"" that'll help to motivate us with ADHD. Even time before the next upcoming task can automatically become breaks.",0,2025-11-28T09:03:38,"We're so happy to hear the app helps you manage your professional and home tasks effectively!

One of my favorite features is the AI ability to just type the due date in the name of the task. The one thing I would really like changed is if emails attached to tasks were stored within Todoist somehow, so I am free to delete them from gmail.",1,2025-11-26T16:45:15,We’re glad you find the cross-platform apps and integrations so valuable!
