5fc8cc5d-2db6-4072-81d2-00b75dccdfa3,Vladimiros Papaditsas,1,OK let's be fair. Slack app is broken. Channels disappear. They used to have a feature to pull down to show you the recent channels you have used and you could at least see the vanished ones by doing this. They removed the feature so it's now literally unusable as half of the channels don't show up.,0,2025-12-02T05:08:38,,

Also, when you set a reminder, or schedule a message, it only shows the numerical date as if someone will remember off top the day of week as well.",1,2025-12-02T03:13:38,"Sorry to hear your app isn't marking messages as read.

I'd give it five stars, except the full range of features are only available by paying a monthly fee for every user. Great if you're a for-profit company but less than ideal if you're not. I'd be happy to pay a small fee for the account managers but that's not an option.",0,2025-12-01T18:17:45,,
