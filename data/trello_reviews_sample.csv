68ed731a-e543-4400-b021-4a38b8bb60b2,Antonio Kemppainen,2,"Easy to understand, easy to keep lists. Way too many bugs. When creating custom rules, these only seem to be applied 50% of the time. Calendar shows tickets on the wrong days, with no way of correcting it. And much more. Very limited in functionality. Would not be surprised if this app can be oneshotted with ChatGPT or similar, except for the cloud functionality and sync.",0,2025-11-25T23:34:35,,

5aa23640-1270-4e90-adb7-2dc036d201f5,Sah Hill,2,"Biggy UI and doesn't have auto save. Imagine typing a paragraph in the description and then switching apps to another one for reference or closing it and switching notes thinking it's saved and then realizing it's not because you forgot to press the green checkmark. So stupid. Luckily, I spent most of my time in a web browser. But if I had to rely on the mobile app, I would pull my hair out.",0,2025-11-21T20:48:35,,

How come on the mobile app I can't seem to copy a checklist easily from another card, for example? Am I the potato or are you guys just trash at UX?
